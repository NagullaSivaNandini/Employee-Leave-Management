# Employee Leave Management System

This project is designed to streamline and automate the process of managing employee leave requests, approvals, and reports. It leverages **MS Access** as the backend database and **Power BI** for interactive data visualization and reporting.


It highlights my ability to work with **databases, data preprocessing, and business intelligence dashboards**.

## 🔄 Data Flow
**MS Access → Excel → Power BI**  
1. MS Access stores raw employee & leave data.  
2. Excel connects to Access for queries and preprocessing.  
3. Power BI imports the processed data from Excel to build dashboards.

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Open `EmployeeLeaveManagement.accdb` in MS Access to explore the database and records.  
2. Connect Excel to Access to extract/clean data.  
3. Open `Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.  
4. Ensure Power BI is connected to Excel/Access (as per file path).  
5. Interact with the dashboard for insights.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- A **web-based portal** for employees to directly apply leave requests.  
- **Automated email notifications** for approvals/rejections.  
- **Role-based access** (HR, Manager, Employee).  
- **Integration with HRMS** for payroll and attendance systems.
